## Plan
1. Give a shout-out to (and user guide for) [regex101](https://regex101.com) 
2. Write up notes based on The Net Ninja's recent, well-explained JS tutorial (playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g6m_6Sld9Q4jzqdqHd2HiD))
3. Provide visual examples
4. Find more resources and write them up
