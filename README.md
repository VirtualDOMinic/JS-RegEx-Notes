# JS-RegEx-Notes
Notes taken about Regular Expressions (specific to JavaScript)

### [Notes here (WIP)](Regular%20Expressions%20(RegEx)%20Tutorial%20Notes.md)

## Plan
1. Give a shout-out to (and user guide for) [regex101](https://regex101.com) 
2. Write up notes based on The Net Ninja's recent, well-explained JS tutorial (playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g6m_6Sld9Q4jzqdqHd2HiD))
3. Provide visual examples
4. Find more resources and write them up: add links to resources, such as [MDN RegExp Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp), [MDN RegEx Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions), [javascript.info RegEx chapter](https://javascript.info/regular-expressions) & [Eloquent JS RegEx](http://eloquentjavascript.net/09_regexp.html)
